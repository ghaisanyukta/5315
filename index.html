      <h2>1. What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is an open source tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, the developer can be sure that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.</p>
      <p>Docker is similar to a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.</p>
      <h2>Advantages of using Dockers</h2>
      <ol>
      	<li>In short, allows you to wrangle dependencies starting from the operating system up to details such as package versions.</li>
      	<li>Running on dockers makes sure that your analyses are reproducible.</li>
      	<li>Portability: Since a Docker container can easily be sent to another machine, you can set up everything on your own computer and then run the analyses on e.g. a more powerful machine.</li>
      	<li>Sharability: You can send the Docker container to anyone (who knows how to work with Docker).
