      <h2>1. What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is an open source tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, the developer can be sure that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.</p>
      <p>Docker is similar to a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.</p>
      <h3>Advantages of using Dockers</h3>
      <ol>
      	<li>In short, allows you to wrangle dependencies starting from the operating system up to details such as package versions.</li>
      	<li>Running on dockers makes sure that your analyses are reproducible.</li>
      	<li>Portability: Since a Docker container can easily be sent to another machine, you can set up everything on your own computer and then run the analyses on e.g. a more powerful machine.</li>
      	<li>Sharability: You can send the Docker container to anyone (who knows how to work with Docker).
      	</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>2. What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>NGINX, pronounced like <q>engine&ndash;ex</q>, is an open-source web server that is now also used as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP), reverse proxy, HTTP cache, and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.</p>
      <p>NGINX is built to offer low memory usage and high concurrency. Rather than creating new processes for each web request, NGINX uses an asynchronous, event-driven approach where requests are handled in a single thread. With NGINX, one master process can control multiple worker processes. The master maintains the worker processes, while the workers do the actual processing. Because NGINX is asynchronous, each request can be executed by the worker concurrently without blocking other requests.</p>

      <h2>3. What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system and can be explained as a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. In other words, creating a computer within a computer. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.</p>
      <p>A virtual machine, usually known as a guest is created within another computing environment referred as a "host." Multiple virtual machines can exist within a single host at one time.</p>
      <p>There are two types of virtual machines:-<p>
      <ol>
      	<li>System virtual machines (full virtualization VMs) provide an alternative for a real machine. They provide functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments which are isolated from one another, yet exist on the same physical machine.</li>
      	<li>Process virtual machines are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>4. Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean was founded in 2011 by Ben Uretsky, Moisey Uretsky, Mitch Wainer, Jeff Carr and Alec Hartman. The company is based in New York City.<p>
      <p>DigitalOcean is a cloud computing vendor that offers an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform for software developers. DigitalOcean is very popular with open source developers and competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Compute Engine.</p>
      <p>To deploy DigitalOcean's Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment, developers launch a private virtual machine (VM) instance, which DigitalOcean calls a "droplet." Developers choose the droplet's size, which geographical region and data center it will run in, and which Linux operating system it will use: Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, CoreOS or FreeBSD.</p>
      <p>They offer features for running, managing, deploying, scaling, security, monitoring, etc.
      </p>
