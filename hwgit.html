      <h2>1.  What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. As with most other distributed version-control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.<p>
      <p>We need a source code Version Control System for the following reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coordination - Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So, a version control system like Git is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts between the developers.</li>
        <li>Easy tracking of changes - Additionally, the requirements in such projects change often. So, a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code.</li>
        <li>Sometimes several projects which are being run in parallel involve the same codebase. In such a case, the concept of branching in Git is very important.</li>
        <li>A copy is maintained on client and server machines – to make sure there is a backup in case of an accident on the local machine.</li>
        <li>Collaboration – Easy to share code and contribute to open source projects</li>
      </ul>
