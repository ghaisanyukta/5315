      <h2>1.  What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. As with most other distributed version-control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.<p>
      <p>We need a source code Version Control System for the following reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coordination - Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So, a version control system like Git is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts between the developers.</li>
        <li>Easy tracking of changes - Additionally, the requirements in such projects change often. So, a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code.</li>
        <li>Sometimes several projects which are being run in parallel involve the same codebase. In such a case, the concept of branching in Git is very important.</li>
        <li>A copy is maintained on client and server machines – to make sure there is a backup in case of an accident on the local machine.</li>
        <li>Collaboration – Easy to share code and contribute to open source projects</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2.  Describe following terms: </h2>
        <h3>a. local repo </h3>
        <p>A local repository is the one on which we will make local changes, typically this local repository is on our computer. You can have the full git experience, with commits, branches, merges, rebases, etc., with only a local repository.</p>
        <h3>b. remote repo </h3>
        <p>A remote repository is the one on the server. The purpose of a remote repository (eg, GitHub) is to publish your code to the world (or to some people) and allow them to read or write it. The remote repository is only involved when you git push your local commits to a remote repository, or when you git pull someone else's commits from it. You don't need to have a remote repository at all.</p>
        <h3>c. how to use GIT in Team Project – multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h3>
        <p>Git allows teams to efficiently and effectively contribute code to the same project in an asynchronous way. The entire team can work on the same code base by pulling changes from the remote repository. Team members can work on different aspects of the code by utilizing branches and committing on them, which can be merged with the remote by creating pull requests and merging them after review. This way a working copy of the code is always maintained on the master branch. Also, in case of an error, the changes can be reverted.</p>
